           Naturally when it came time to purchase x-mas gifts for my family and friends, i wanted to get them some Merit America gear so they could look good and spread the word
          about a great cause. Unfortunetly when i looked online, there was no such thing as a Merit America shop....so i made one.
          Please feel free to browse the site and learn more about the program.
